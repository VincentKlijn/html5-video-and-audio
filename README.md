# html5-video-and-audio
This repository includes a demonstration of html5 video and audio tags.

The video uses custom made controls, while the audio uses the standard controls.

### The HTML
The HTML is heavily commented to make identifying the elements easy and to understand their function. This is a very basic html file.
Additional video and audio attributes are mentioned as reference.

### The CSS
The CSS is heavily commented to explain the individual rules.

### The JavaScript
The JavaScript library is an external file, called from the html file. It contains all functions necessary for making the custom video controls work.

All JavaScript is heavily commented, almost on a line-by-line basis, explaining what is going on.
